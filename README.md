a restaurant html/css/pureJS template using some atomic css.

Ultra small.

From author of the urals.css framework.

All the work of the framework performs invisibly, providing the output of atomic classes. Which can be seen in the file -> src/scss/_trumps.atomic.scss. No other dependencies. Very small code on the output.
