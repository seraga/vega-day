a restaurant html/css/pureJS template using some atomic css.

Ultra small.

From author of the [UralsCss](https://uralscss.firebaseapp.com/) framework/transpiler.

All the work of the framework performs invisibly, providing the output of atomic classes. Which can be seen in the file -> src/scss/_trumps.atomic.scss. Very small code on the output.
